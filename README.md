# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

  - Ranger-bear-wildfire is a web-based game that has the same rules as rock-paper-scissors. The difficult mode has five choices, ranger, wildfire, bear, moose and storm. This game is played against the computer, which randomly generates a choice. After a round of the game the results are displayed along with the score, and the game automatically resets.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

  - This solo project was assigned at the beginning of week five of the Turing Front End Software Development program. We were given seven days to complete the project, and I spent roughly 25 hours completing the project. The spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html)

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

 - This project was completed by <a href="https://github.com/Eleanorgruth">Eleanor Ruth.</a>


### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

  - Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
  - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  - Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Technology Used

  - Atom
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Chrome Dev Tools
  - JavaScript
  - Github

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

  - Wins:
    - This was the first project where we were given creative freedom to make the game board. I really enjoyed this process and found it extremely beneficial for my learning of CSS and HTML.
    - I utilized replit to troubleshoot my game logic which then made it easy to drop that logic into the `Game` class. 

  - Challenges:
    - When I started this project I was using the `Game` and `Player` class very minimally, and had most of the functionality in the the `main.js` file in global functions. I knew that I needed to use the classes in order to update the data model before updating the DOM, this lead me to complete a major refactor which was extremely challenging. I worked with my mentor and I was able to learn so much more about class to class interaction through this process.
